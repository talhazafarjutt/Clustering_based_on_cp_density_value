# Clustering_based_on_cp_density_value
Its a little bit example to minimize time of clustering in cpp.

this code is 2 years old so dataset is missing, you can change it 
according to your requirments and it is highly optimized on my computer
clusters are made on the given value of the cp and density 
you can also visualize the clusters by using your libraries.


sorting technique could be changed on your requirments 
and on your dataset.



you can also use threading ,openmp or others libraries 
to maximize the output and reduce the time.
